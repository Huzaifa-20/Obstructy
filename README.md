# Obstructy

## About
Obstructy is an academic project which aims to provide a mobile application for basic video processing/editing. Its key purpose is to make available the "Learning to See Through Obstructions" work by Yu-Lun Liu1, Wei-Sheng Lai, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Yung-Yu Chuang, and Jia-Bin Huang [https://alex04072000.github.io/ObstructionRemoval/].

As tools and technologies, the project uses primarily Java, Android Studio (for the mobile app), TensorFlow, Python (for the model), and other tools/libraries for various features that augment the project.

## Requirements

- Android Studio 
- Java SDK [recent most LTS would suffice, but any SDK should also work]
